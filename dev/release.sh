# Sequence (every step exits non-zero on first failure):
#   1. sanity-check args, env, working copy, CHANGELOG draft
#   2. run the full test suite
#   3. bump the version in build.clj, README.md, docs/tutorial.md;
#      rename `## Unreleased` in CHANGELOG.md to `## VERSION` and
#      restore a fresh `## Unreleased` placeholder above it
#   4. describe the commit, advance master, start a fresh working copy
#   5. clean + deploy the jar to Clojars
#   6. push master via `jj git push`
#   7. create an annotated git tag (not a jj bookmark) and push it
